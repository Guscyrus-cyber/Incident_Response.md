Incidence response and handling has become quite a crucial, indispensible constituent of information technology security management, as it provides an organised way of handling the aftermaths of a security breach. It presents an organisationâ€™s reaction to illegitimate and unacceptable exploits on its assets or infrastructure. The goal must be to successfully neutralise the incident, such that damages are significantly reduced with attendant reduction in recovery time and costs. To achieve this, several approaches and methodologies proposed have been reviewed with a view to identifying essential processes. What is needed is referred to as incident capability mingled with collaborations. This defines a shift from response to management of computer security incidents in anointer relationship manner that foster collaboration through the exchange and sharing of incidence management details among several distinct organizations. Key step-up aspects centre on issues of enforcing and assuring trust and privacy. A viable collaborative incident response approach must be able to proffer both proactive and reactive mechanisms that are management-oriented and incorporating all required techniques and procedures.
